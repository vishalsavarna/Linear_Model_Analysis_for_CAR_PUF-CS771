#Linear Model Analysis for Companion Arbiter PUFs (CAR-PUF)(CS771) Guide: Prof. Purushottam Kar
◦ Developed a novel approach for CAR-PUF modeling with linear models, expanding features to 528 dimensions.
◦ Achieved over 98% accuracy in predicting CAR-PUF responses using ML techniques (LinearSVC, LogisticRegression).
◦ Analyzed the impact of hyperparameters (C, loss, tol) on training time and accuracy, providing insights for optimization.
◦ Demonstrated strong analytical and mathematical skills in implementing complex algorithms for PUF modeling.
